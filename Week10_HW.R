#### Objective 1 ----

#### Part A 
# Using either your own data or data that you find in an online database,
#find two continuous variables that might reasonably be hypothesized to have a 
#causal association (i.e., one variable is clearly the response, Y, and the 
#other the predictor, X) and have sufficient numbers of paired observations (> 30)

#For our homework, we found this paper from Kenna et al (2021) in Functional Ecology
#title: Thermal flight performance reveals impact of warming on bumblebee foraging potential
#relevant since Elizabeth and I both work on bumble bees

#pull the data in, this paper stored the information through Dryad
#not entirely sure if Dryad has a dynamic query option in R, so we downloaded the file to use
